# ThoughtScript

**A Dynamic Programming Language for Thought-Based Computing**

ThoughtScript is an innovative programming language designed to bridge human thinking patterns with computational logic. It emphasizes readability, natural language constructs, and intuitive programming paradigms.

## 🌟 Features

- **Natural Language Syntax**: Write code that reads like thoughts
- **Thought-Based Variables**: Dynamic typing with semantic understanding
- **Mind Mapping**: Visual representation of code structure
- **Intuitive Functions**: Built-in functions that mirror human cognitive processes
- **Interactive REPL**: Real-time thought evaluation
- **Web IDE**: Browser-based development environment
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI-powered code completion

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd thoughtscript

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

### Your First ThoughtScript Program

```thoughtscript
think "Hello, World!" as greeting
express greeting

consider number from 1 to 10:
    if number is even:
        remember number as "even"
    otherwise:
        remember number as "odd"

show memories
```

## 📖 Language Reference

### Basic Syntax

- `think`: Declare variables with intention
- `express`: Output to console
- `consider`: Loop through values
- `if/otherwise`: Conditional logic
- `remember`: Store values in memory
- `show`: Display stored information

### Data Types

- **Thoughts**: String values representing ideas
- **Numbers**: Integer and floating-point values
- **Concepts**: Arrays and collections
- **Memories**: Key-value storage
- **Intentions**: Function definitions
